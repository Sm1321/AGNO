# AGNO

### What is Agno

#### Agno is a lightweight, high-performance library for building Agents.

It helps you progressively build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:

- Level 1: Agents with tools and instructions.
- Level 2: Agents with knowledge and storage.
- Level 3: Agents with memory and reasoning.
- Level 4: Teams of Agents with collaboration and coordination.
- Level 5: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.

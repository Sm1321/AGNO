# AGNO

### What is Agno

#### Agno is a lightweight, high-performance library for building Agents.

It helps you progressively build the 5 levels of Agentic Systems:

- `Level 1`: Agents with tools and instructions.
- `Level 2`: Agents with knowledge and storage.
- `Level 3`: Agents with memory and reasoning.
- `Level 4`: Teams of Agents with collaboration and coordination.
- `Level 5`: Agentic Workflows with state and determinism.
